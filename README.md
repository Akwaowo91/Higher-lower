## üöÄ About
**Higher-lower**  is a simple web-based number guessing game built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The game randomly selects a number between 0 and 9, and the user has to guess the number by entering it in the URL.

## üìÑ Code Explanation
  - The root route (/) provides instructions to the user to guess a number within this range, accompanied by an image. A dynamic route ('/<int:guess>') is defined to check the user's guess, providing feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct, each with a corresponding image. Additionally, the code includes a decorator make_bold to bold the text returned by any function it wraps, although this decorator is not used in the current implementation.
